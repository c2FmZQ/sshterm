# SSH Term

SSH Term is a full-featured SSH client that runs entirely in your web browser.

The core client is written in Go and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), allowing it to run client-side. It uses [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for the terminal interface and connects to standard SSH servers through a [tlsproxy](https://github.com/c2FmZQ/tlsproxy) WebSocket proxy.

## Features

*   Connect to any SSH server, including via jump hosts.
*   SFTP client with streaming uploads and downloads.
*   In-memory SSH agent and agent forwarding.
*   Public key authentication with certificates.
*   WebAuthn support for security keys and passkeys.
*   Generate, import, and export SSH keys (rsa, ecdsa, ecdsa-sk, ed25519).
*   Backup and restore configuration and keys.
*   Keyboard-interactive authentication.
*   Persistence of data to browser local storage.

## Getting Started

You can get started by either downloading a pre-built release or by building the project from source.

### Installation

**Option 1: Download a Release**

You can find pre-packaged releases on the [releases page](https://github.com/c2FmZQ/sshterm/releases). Download the `sshterm-docroot-${VERSION}.tar.gz` file, which contains all the necessary files ready to be deployed.

**Option 2: Build from Source**

If you have Go and Node.js installed, you can build the project yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c2FmZQ/sshterm.git
cd sshterm
./build.sh
```

After the build completes, the `docroot/` directory will contain all the required application files.

### Configuration

SSH Term connects to SSH servers via a WebSocket proxy. You will need to configure `tlsproxy` to forward connections.

1.  **Configure `tlsproxy`**

    Create a `tlsproxy` configuration file. Here is a minimal example:

    ```yaml
    backends:
      - serverNames:
          - ssh.example.com
        mode: local
        documentRoot: /path/to/your/docroot/

    webSockets:
      - endpoint: wss://ssh.example.com/myserver
        address: 192.168.0.100:22
    ```
    *Update the `serverNames`, `documentRoot`, `endpoint`, and `address` to match your environment.*

2.  **Configure the Endpoint in the App**

    Open the SSH Term URL in your browser (e.g., `https://ssh.example.com`). The first time you use it, you must configure the server endpoint with the `ep` command:

    ```console
    ep add myserver wss://ssh.example.com/myserver
    ```
    The URL can also be a relative path, e.g. `./myserver`.
    Alternatively, you can provide this configuration in a `config.json` file in the `docroot` directory.

### Using `config.json`

As an alternative to configuring endpoints manually with the `ep` command, you can create a `config.json` file in the `docroot/` directory to pre-configure the application. This is useful for deploying SSH Term with a default set of connections and settings.

Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and modify it to fit your needs.

Here is an example with explanations of the fields:

```json
{
	"persist": false,
	"theme": "dark",
	"certificateAuthorities": [{
		"name": "my_ca_example_com",
		"publicKey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOO4jC9AcVsCOfapTGboTKOuMbil0Z8jKnt3pb3M8eqi",
		"hostnames": [ "*.example.com" ]
	}],
	"endpoints": [{
		"name": "myserver.example.com",
		"url": "./websocket"
	}],
	"hosts": [{
		"name": "myserver.example.com",
		"key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINqyuT/sFvC37z1qMY0may2TMKqg2nxdjxBxyfXeieot"
	}],
	"generateKeys": [{
		"name": "default",
		"type": "ed25519",
		"identityProvider": "./cert",
		"addToAgent": true
	}],
	"autoConnect": {
		"username": "username",
		"hostname": "myserver.example.com",
		"identity": "default",
		"command": "uname -a",
		"forwardAgent": false
	}
}
```

*   `endpoints`: Pre-defines WebSocket endpoints. This is the same as using the `ep add` command.
*   `hosts`: Pre-defines known host keys to trust.
*   `certificateAuthorities`: Specifies trusted CAs for host certificates.
*   `generateKeys`: Can be used to generate a new SSH key on first use.
*   `autoConnect`: Automatically connect to a specified host on startup.
*   `persist`: Controls whether settings are saved to the browser's local storage.
*   `theme`: Sets the visual theme (e.g., "dark", "light").

## Usage

This section explains how to use the SSH Term application, from initial setup to a complete command reference.

### Quick Start

Follow these steps to get connected for the first time.

1.  **Configure the Server Endpoint**

    Before you can connect, you must tell SSH Term how to reach your SSH server via its WebSocket proxy. Use the `ep add` command to add a new endpoint.

    ```console
    ep add my-server wss://ssh.example.com/my-server
    ```
    Replace `my-server` with a name of your choice and the URL with the one provided by your `tlsproxy` configuration. The URL can be absolute or relative.

2.  **Generate an SSH Key**

    Next, generate a new SSH key to use for authentication. The `keys generate` command creates a new key and adds it to the local keystore.

    ```console
    keys generate -t ed25519 my-key
    ```
    This creates a new `ed25519` key named `my-key`. You can see your new key by running `keys list`. Don't forget to add the public key to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

3.  **Connect to Your Server**

    Now you can connect to your server using the `ssh` command.

    ```console
    ssh user@my-server
    ```
    SSH Term will use the endpoint you configured to establish the connection.

### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/c2FmZQ/sshterm.git
    cd sshterm
    ```

### Code Structure

The codebase is organized into the following main directories:

*   `go/`: Contains all the Go source code for the SSH client. This code is compiled into a WebAssembly (`.wasm`) module.
    *   `go/internal/app/`: Defines all the application's commands (`ssh`, `keys`, `ep`, etc.).
    *   `go/internal/indexeddb/`: A Go wrapper for the browser's IndexedDB API for local storage.
    *   `go/internal/jsutil/`: Utilities for Go-to-JavaScript interoperability.
    *   `go/internal/terminal/`: A Go wrapper for the `xterm.js` terminal to handle I/O.
    *   `go/internal/shellwords/`: Handles shell-style command-line parsing.
    *   `go/internal/websocket/`: Implements a `net.Conn` interface over a browser WebSocket.
    *   `go/internal/webauthnsk/`: Implements the `ecdsa-sk` (WebAuthn) key type.
    *   `go/internal/tests/`: Contains internal end-to-end tests for the Go application, which are also compiled to WASM and run in a browser.
    *   `go/internal/testserver/`: A backend server used for running the internal Go tests, providing a mock SSH server and other endpoints.
*   `docroot/`: The web root for the application. It contains the main `index.html`, the compiled `ssh.wasm` binary, and the necessary JavaScript and CSS assets. This is the directory you would serve to users.
*   `xterm/`: Contains the `xterm.js` frontend component and its dependencies, which provides the terminal UI.
*   `tests/`: Contains scripts and Docker configurations for running the end-to-end browser tests.
*   `build.sh`: The main build script that compiles the Go code into WASM and moves all necessary assets into the `docroot/` directory.

2.  **Run the tests:**
    You can run the test suite to verify your changes.

    *   **Headless Mode:** To run the tests in a headless browser, execute:
        ```console
        ./tests/run-headless-tests.sh
        ```

    *   **Interactive Mode:** To run the tests in your own browser for debugging, start the test server:
        ```console
        ./tests/run-test-server.sh
        ```
        Then, open `http://<hostname>:8443/tests.html` in your browser.
